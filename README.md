# physiological-test-anxiety-detection
This project explores short-term exam anxiety reduction in students using physiological signals (GSR, HRV) captured via the Empatica EmbracePlus. We evaluate the impact of guided breathing and Indian classical Raga Bhairavi interventions through non-parametric statistics and ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) with >98% accuracy and F1 score.
